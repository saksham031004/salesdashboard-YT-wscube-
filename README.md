📈 Sales Performance and Trend Analysis Dashboard
🎯 Short Description / Purpose
This Tableau Sales Dashboard, titled "sales dashboard (yt-wscube)", is an interactive data visualization project designed for sales monitoring and strategic business analysis. It provides a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of key sales performance indicators (KPIs), allowing users to quickly identify revenue trends, analyze product performance, and monitor regional sales effectiveness. The main goal is to transform raw sales transactional data into clear, actionable insights for effective decision-making and performance management.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies:

📊 Tableau Desktop – The primary platform used for connecting to the data, creating calculated fields, and designing the interactive dashboards and worksheets.

🧠 Tableau Calculated Fields / LOD Expressions – Used for creating advanced metrics (e.g., Year-over-Year sales change, custom rolling averages, profit margins) necessary for deep trend analysis.

📂 Tableau Hyper – The project uses a Tableau Hyper data extract for efficient, high-performance querying of the underlying sales data.

The data source is stored internally within the workbook: Data/TableauTemp/#TableauTemp_0qod4s01kazbne196g8et0ze23gr.hyper.

📁 File Format – Developed as a Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx), which includes the dashboard, worksheets, and the hyper data extract, making it readily viewable and shareable.

📊 Data Source
The project utilizes a dataset suitable for a retail or wholesale business sales analysis practice, specifically identified with a reference to YouTube tutorials (yt-wscube).

Source: Practice Sales Data from a YouTube-based tutorial (wscube).

Data Content: Based on typical sales analysis needs, the underlying data likely includes records on:

Sales Metrics: Revenue, Profit, and Quantity Sold.

Temporal Data: Order Date, Shipping Date, and related time intelligence elements.

Product Hierarchy: Product Name, Category, and Sub-Category.

Geographical Data: Region, State, and City information.

✨ Features / Highlights
The primary function of this dashboard is to provide clear, actionable insights into sales operations and performance.

Business Problem: The dashboard addresses the difficulty of extracting meaningful patterns and performance anomalies from raw, high-volume sales transactional data.

Goal of the Dashboard: To create an intuitive, filter-enabled interface for users to monitor performance, simplify comparisons across different business dimensions, and pinpoint areas needing sales intervention or opportunity exploitation.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Hypothetical based on standard sales dashboard practice)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displays major financial metrics such as Total Sales and Total Profit, often highlighted with clear, bold cards for immediate performance checks.

Sales Trend Analysis: Features line charts to visualize Sales over time (e.g., monthly or yearly), crucial for identifying growth, dips, or seasonal patterns.

Geographic Performance: Includes a map or tree map to analyze Sales by Region or State, allowing for quick visual identification of top and bottom-performing geographical areas.

Product/Category Analysis: Uses bar charts to rank Product Categories and Sub-Categories by performance (e.g., total profit or sales) to inform inventory and marketing strategy.

Profitability View: Visualizations (like scatter plots or bar charts) dedicated to showing the relationship between Sales and Profit to identify products or regions with healthy versus poor margins.
